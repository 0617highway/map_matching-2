# Parameters to guide the computational performance
processing:
  cores: 1


geoprocessing parameters:
  buffer size: 0.0006 #Buffer around the links to capture links likely used. Unit is degrees
                      # Each 0.0001 correspond to approximately 11m (36ft) in the radius of the buffer
  azimuth tolerance: 22.5  # In case the network and the GPS data have azimuths, this is the tolerance to be used to
                           # to define if a GPS ping could have used a certain link

  network file fields:
    azimuth: Azimuth # If no Azimuth, put -1
    id: ID
    direction: DIR
    cost: LENGTH
    interpolation: LENGTH


data quality:
  max speed: 130    # in kmph
  max speed time: 120      # in seconds   --> time that the truck needs to be above the speed limit to be scraped
  minimum pings: 20 # Minimum number of pings that the vehicle needs to have to be considered valid
  minimum coverage: 2 # Minimum diagonal of the Bounding box (km) defined by the GPS pings to be considered a valid vehicle

stops parameters:
# Time in seconds
# Distance in km. Measured as Great circle distance between each consecutive ping
  Maximum space:
    time: 1200
    min distance: 5
    max distance: 20

#This is the algorithm commonly used for ATRI truck GPS data. Initially developed by Pinjari et. Al and improved by
# Camargo, Hong and Livshits (2017)
  Delivery stop:
    stopped speed: 8  # in km/h
    min time stopped: 300 # 5*60 in seconds   --> minimum stopped time to be considered
    max time stopped: 14400 # 4*60*60 in seconds   --> maximum stopped time to be considered
    max stop coverage: 0.8 # in kilometers
